					A shorter and lighter version of the Gewehr 98 that served through the First World War, the Karabiner 98k served as the backbone of the German military through the Second World War. With its two front locking lugs and excellent gas handling system, its Mauser-designed bolt system serves as the foundation for hunting and sniper rifles to this day. Post-war, K98ks would turn up in Korea and Vietnam (as captured examples, through Soviet aid) as well as to this day, in Syria, Afghanistan, and innumerable other conflicts.
