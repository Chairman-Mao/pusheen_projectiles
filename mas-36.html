					Drawing lessons from World War I, the French combined the best features of the period in their rifle adopted in 1936: the 5-round internal magazine of the German Mauser 98, the rear locking lugs of the British Lee-Enfield, and the aperture sights of the British/American M1917 Enfield. Though it would see relatively little service during World War II, owing to France's ill-fated early defeat, it would go on to serve extensively during France's Algerian and Vietnam conflicts. Today, caches of MAS-36s can still be found in the hands of rebels in the Syrian Civil War.
