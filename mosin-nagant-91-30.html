					With over 37 million of these rifles produced and many of those millions sold en masse in surplus markets worldwide, the Mosin-Nagant has a reputation for delivering solid performance at a very low premium. Adopted in 1891, it was the brainchild of Captain Sergei Mosin, and Belgian designer Leon Nagant (who successfully brought legal pressure upon the Russian government for financial compensation, despite the final design using virtually none of his contributions). It would likely be easier to count the number of 20th and 21st century conflicts that the Mosin-Nagant *wasn't* involved in than the ones it was. Most recently, the Mosin-Nagant has been sighted in the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and in Syria.
