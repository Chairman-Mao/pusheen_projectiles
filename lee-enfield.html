					Adopted in 1895, the Lee-Enfield takes its name from James Paris Lee, the designer of its bolt system, and the Royal Small Arms Factory in Enfield, responsible for its overall design. It soldiered through two World Wars, as the primary infantry rifle for the British Army and its myriad colonies. A solid, rugged rifle with twice the magazine capacity of most of its contemporaries, the Lee-Enfield was a reliable companion even the harshest of conditions. Today, it still sees use with Indian and Bangladeshi police, as well as with the Canadian Rangers of the Arctic.
